Setup google analytics 
--------
To get your site properly indexed and see search data directly in your Google Analytics dashboard, you need to follow these two main steps:

1. Set Up Google Search Console (GSC)
Google Search Console is what tells Google, "Hey, my website exists, please crawl it."

Go to Google Search Console.
Click Start Now and log in with the same Google account you used for Google Analytics.
Add a Property:
If you have a custom domain (e.g., isme-azam-calculator.com), use the Domain option.
If you are hosting on a subfolder or free service, use the URL prefix option and enter your full URL (e.g., https://yourname.github.io/project/).
Verify Ownership:
Since I've already added the Google Analytics script to your 
index.html
, the easiest way is to choose Google Analytics as the verification method.
GSC will check for the code I added, and if it's there, you'll be verified instantly.
2. Link GSC to Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
Linking them allows you to see which keywords people typed into Google to find your site.

Open Google Analytics.
Go to Admin (the gear icon at the bottom left).
Ensure you have the correct Account and Property selected.
In the Property column, scroll down to Product Links and click on Search Console Links.
Click the blue Link button.
Click Choose accounts and select the Search Console property you just verified.
Click Confirm > Next.
Select the Web Stream (this is your website) and click Next.
Review and Submit.
